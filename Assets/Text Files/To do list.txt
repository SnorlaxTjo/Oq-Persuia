WHAT TO DO BEFORE DEADLINE JAN 12

- Make a death screen with option to reload from last save or exit to main menu
- Fix all the options. Make them actually change stuff
- Make options save when exiting the game
- Natural regeneration
- Disable saving in certain situations
- Let every world have their standard values, and use triggers to change them.

(If possible, not necessary, but would be nice)
- Add audio to main menu
- Fix player animation to make it look better
- Try to fix the player moving issue in build mode

Remove all debugging stuff (Hotkeys, quick teleporter, etc.)
Remove all unnecessary references in all scripts (using)
